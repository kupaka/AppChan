* Reorganize 4chan x UI to look more uniform and less cluttered -- still gross.
* Work on custom icons for stickies and closed threads -- abandoned.
* More mascots -- addressed but never finished. ;3
* Port more color schemes to Custom AppChan
	> Solarized
	> Zenburned
	> Tomorrow
	> Photon
	> ObsidianChan
	> Yotsuba
	> Yotsuba B
	> Yotsuba+B?
* Keep up to date on bugs and work harder to find and squash them
* Get an anonymous bug reporting page set up
* Work on a small companion script to add functionality to AppChan that wouldn't otherwise be possible to have
	> Like a slide out postform that slides out whenever any contained input has focus
	> Or the ability to shuffle through mascots and add your own via an embedded interface (like 4chan-style-script)
* Add more navigation options
* Work on vertical pages orientation to not colide with other UI -- Resolved with slideout watcher?
